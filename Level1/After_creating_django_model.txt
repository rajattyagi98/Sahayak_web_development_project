Now, we can create students and teachers in the admin interface or using the Django shell:

Python
>>> from .models import Student, Teacher

>>> student = Student.objects.create(name="Alice")
>>> teacher = Teacher.objects.create(name="Bob")

>>> student.teachers.add(teacher)
>>> teacher.students.add(student)

>>> student.teachers.all()
<QuerySet [<Teacher: Bob>]>

>>> teacher.students.all()
<QuerySet [<Student: Alice>]>
