#To generate a certificate for a teacher and student pair, we can use the following code:

from django.http import HttpResponse
from django.template.loader import render_to_string

def generate_certificate(teacher, student):
    certificate_template = "certificate.html"
    context = {
        "teacher": teacher,
        "student": student,
    }

    html = render_to_string(certificate_template, context)
    return HttpResponse(html, content_type="text/html")

# Example usage:

teacher = Teacher.objects.get(id=1)
student = Student.objects.get(id=1)

certificate = generate_certificate(teacher, student)
certificate.render()

The certificate.html template can be used to generate a certificate in any desired format, such as PDF or HTML.
